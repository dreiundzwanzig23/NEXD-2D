README for the Matlab script 'calc_vel.m'
Date: 07. June 2017; Author: Janis Heuel, Marc S. Boxberg, Ruhr-Universitaet Bochum, Germany

The Matlab script 'calc_vel.m' calculates wavespeeds and inverse quality factors of elastic and poroelastic materials.
This script is written in MATLAB R2014b.
Start the script by writing 'calc_vel' in the Matlab command window.
The whole script needs the following scripts:

calc_vel.m
plotting_output.m
porousmaterial.m
printing_output.m
proof_source.m
reading_parfile.m
reading_sources.m
read_input.m

These script should be in a folder with the name 'tools'.
The calcuation needs the following files (the filename is given with the relative path from tools):

../data/source
../data/parfile
../cubit/matpropporo

The parameters with the index 1 describe the wetting fluid and the parameters with index 2 the non wetting fluid.

Some parameters can be set in file 'calc_vel.m' and 'plotting_output.m':
'calc_vel.m' (line 12-20):
%%###############################
%% CONVENIENCE PARAMETERS
plot_diag      			= true; 		% if plot_diag = true, the plots are displayed
save_plot   			= true;			% if saves_plot = true, the plot is saved in available formattypes in matlab
formattype 			= '-dpng'
attenuation_default 		= true;			% if attenuation_default = true, the invers quality factor is calculated
logfile 			= true;			% Set true if logfile should be created, otherwise false
k_default      			= 40;			% Length of all vectors
wavelet_amplitude   		= 0.001;		% minimal value of amplitude of fourier transformation of the wavelet,
							% used for frequency estimation. E.g. wavelet_amplitude = 0.001, then 0.1 % of the
%%###############################			% highest amplitude for the highest frequency

Here, it is possible to choose if the plots should be displayed, the attenuation should be calculated or a logfile of the printed output on the
commend window should be saved in the folder 'out'. This folder is created by the script.
If plot_diag = false, then k_default is set automatically to 2. The time, how long the calculation needs, depends on k_default. If k_default has
a great value, then the calculation needs more time if the viscosity of the fluids is not zero. For low values, the plots are inexact.
The value wavelet_amplitude controls the frequency range, because a fourier transformation is done for green-, ricker- and external-wavelet to
estimate the frequencies. The value is multiplied with the highest amplitude of the FFT. The result is an amplitude, where the highest
frequency is determined of the wavelet.


'plotting_output' (line 4-14):
%##########################################################
% YOU CAN CHANGE FOR OTHER AXIS LABELS AND UNITS THE FOLLOWING LINES
xlabel_unit = Frequency;          % unit of x-axis
xaxis_label = 'Frequency f [Hz]'; % label of x-axis

%xlabel_unit = omega;
%xaxis_label = 'Angular frequency \omega [rad/s]';

y_axis_label_wavespeed = 'Wavespeed [m/s]';
y_axis_label_Q	       = 'Q^{-1}';
%##########################################################

Here, it is possible to change the unit of the x-axis. Both the frequency [Hz] as the angular frequency [rad/s] can be chosen. Furthermore, it is
possible to change the labels of the y-axes by setting other strings for y_axis_label_wavespeed and y_axis_label_Q.
